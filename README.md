The system is a comprehensive program designed to manage and analyze country data through an object-oriented approach. At its core, it features a `Country` class that encapsulates essential attributes of a country, such as its name, population, and area. The class includes methods for initializing these attributes, retrieving and setting their values, and performing calculations related to country metrics. Specifically, it provides functionality to compare the area of one country with another, calculate population density, and display country information in a formatted manner.

The system also includes a `List` class, which has been modified to handle `Country` objects rather than simple strings. This class manages a collection of `Country` instances, allowing users to add countries to the list, check if the list is full, and display the list status. In addition, the `List` class has been enhanced with three new methods that facilitate basic operations such as removing a country, searching for a specific country, and printing the details of all countries in a tabular format.

The driver program serves as the interface for interacting with these classes. It allows users to populate the list with five different `Country` objects, find the country with the largest area, and exercise the new methods added to the `List` class. The output includes a clear tabular display of all country details, including their names, populations, and areas, providing an organized and accessible view of the data.
